This is a daily tracker for chores and hobbies, which rewards good boy points. 
This is a very early WIP, mostly copilot since i'm new to web design in general.
Just been learing html for the past few days, once i'm more confident i'll move into CSS, then js
js does look fun though

TO DO:
add constants that are there every day (checkboxes)
don't decide the points yourself, need a set value for each activity
custom activities with custom values if needed (within a certain range)
