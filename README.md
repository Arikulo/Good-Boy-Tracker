This is a daily tracker for chores and hobbies, which rewards good boy points. This is a very early WIP, mostly copilot since i'm new to web design in general.
Just been learing html for the past few days, 

TO DO:
add constants that are there every day (checkboxes)
don't decide the points yourself, need a set value for each activity
custom activities with custom values if needed (within a certain range)
